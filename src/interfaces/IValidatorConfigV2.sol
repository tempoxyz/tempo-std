/// @title IValidatorConfigV2 - Validator Config V2 Precompile Interface
/// @notice Interface for managing consensus validators with append-only, delete-once semantics
/// @dev This precompile manages the set of validators that participate in consensus.
///      V2 uses an append-only design that eliminates the need for historical state access
///      during node recovery. Validators are immutable after creation and can only be deleted once.
///
///      Key differences from V1:
///      - `active` bool replaced by `addedAtHeight` and `deactivatedAtHeight`
///      - No `updateValidator` - validators are immutable after creation
///      - Requires Ed25519 signature on `addValidator` to prove key ownership
///      - Both address and public key must be unique across all validators (including deleted)
